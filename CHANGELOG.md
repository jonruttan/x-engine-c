# Changelog

All notable changes to the C engine are recorded here.

This repository was split out of [x-lang][x-lang] and carries the full history
of the C sources, headers, C spec suite and contract manifests — 503 commits,
reaching back to the first evaluator. Everything before the split is also in
x-lang's own [CHANGELOG][x-changelog], where the engine's changes are recorded
alongside the library changes they landed with.

[x-changelog]: https://github.com/jonruttan/x-lang/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md

## Unreleased

### Changed

- **The C engine is its own repository.** `src/`, `include/`, `opt/`,
  `tests/c/`, the `ext/x-expr` submodule, the Doxygen C reference and the
  contract manifests for the C surface moved here from x-lang, keeping their
  repo-relative paths and their history. x-lang consumes this repo as a
  submodule and builds `x-bin` from it.

  The contract manifests did NOT come along, and that is the load-bearing
  decision: `lib/x-core.x` includes `base-paths.x` and `obj-layout.x` as the
  first things it loads and `pin.x` reads `isa.x` at runtime, so they are boot
  data for the library rather than descriptions of the engine. They stay in
  x-lang with the gates that check them, which now scan this repo across the
  submodule boundary. `tools/contract/base-layout.x` is the exception — a pure
  build input for `gen-layout` — and it lives here.

  `X_RELEASE` now defaults to *this* repo's `git describe` for a standalone
  build; x-lang passes its own tag down when it builds the submodule, so the
  engine keeps reporting the language release it was built for and the pin
  guard's pairing check is unchanged.
